I wrote simple login and registration web application using Java with Spring MVC and MySql as a database.
This is an example app.

In order to use the app you should create MySQL user (username: "userLogin", password: "userLogin"), then schema or db with name of "user_login_database".
And finally "user" table with columns ("id", "first_name", "last_name", "country", "email", "password", "rePassword".
